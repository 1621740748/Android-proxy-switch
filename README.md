# Android-proxy-switch
Simple app to change your proxy, when doing this manual from your settings this can get annoying since you have to rewrite to proxy's ip and port everytime. 

## usage
Install fastproxyswitch.apk on android phone

## note
The shell command for changing the proxy settings are ran using 'su', this is actually not needed, just remove the 'su' part from the code and rebuild the app if you don't have a rooted device.
